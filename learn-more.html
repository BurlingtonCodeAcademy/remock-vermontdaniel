              And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it. I feel like I was mauled by Jesus. Can we have Bender Burgers again? THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE
              GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN! Daddy Bender, we're hungry. You can see how I lived before I met you. Hey, whatcha watching? She also liked to shut up! Enough about your
              promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems. I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope? Bender, quit destroying the
              universe! Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems. Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood! But, like most
              politicians, he promised more than he could deliver. The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards.
              Checkmate. Actually, that's still true. In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their
              stemcells. Oh yeah, good luck with that. Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor. I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now
              all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas. I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that. Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and
              worried? Well I'da done better, but it's plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence. I'm Santa Claus! I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the
              lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh… also, comes with double prize money. Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor. Maybe I love

              honored. Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way? Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy. I can explain. It's very valuable. Of all the friends I've had… you're the first. Noooooo! Oh
