          <p>Daddy Bender, we're hungry. We're also Santa Claus! Pansy. Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually!</p>

          <p>I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in. Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money.</p>

          <p>Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away! Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer.</p>

          <p>Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase. Shut up and take my money!</p>

            <img src="https://www.fillmurray.com/100/100" /> Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them? And why did 'I' have to take a cab? Good
            news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love! What kind of a father would I be if I said no? Man, I'm
            sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor.

            <img src="https://www.fillmurray.com/100/100" /> No, I'm Santa Claus! Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family. Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to
            interfere in his life. I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan! I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope? Bender, quit destroying the universe!

          And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it. I feel like I was mauled by Jesus. Can we have Bender Burgers again? THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST!
          NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN! Daddy Bender, we're hungry. You can see how I lived before I met you. Hey, whatcha watching? She also liked to shut up! Enough about your promiscuous
          mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems. I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope? Bender, quit destroying the universe! Enough
          about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems. Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood! But, like most politicians, he
          promised more than he could deliver. The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate. Actually, that's
          still true.

          In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells. Oh yeah, good luck with that. Man, I'm
          sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor. I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about
          our mamas. I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that. Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried? Well I'da done better, but it's plum hard
          pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence. I'm Santa Claus! I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh…
          also, comes with double prize money. Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor. Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be.
          Take me to your leader! One hundred dollars.

          I wish! It's a nickel. Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock. No, she'll probably make me do it. Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music. Spare me
          your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun! You guys realize you live in a sewer, right? I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan! You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare
          you lie in front of Jesus? I don't want to be rescued. I wish! It's a nickel. It may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt
          to him like fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels. Belligerent and numerous. It doesn't look so shiny to me. Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive!
          Also, we're dying! Leela's gonna kill me. Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions? Anyone who laughs is a communist!
